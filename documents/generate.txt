Auto Compile Generation
=======================

00 	offset to next [0 = end of list]
01 	token match (low)
02 	token match (high)
03+ generation sequences NIBL packed, high low evaluation order.

Byte parameters use padding and next byte. Word order is low/high

0 	Padding / no-operation
1 	Output token 1 byte		T:token_id (must be in 2nd nibble) T on its own => same name as match.
2	Output token 2 byte 	T:token_id (must be in 2nd nibble)
3 	Call Routine 2 byte 	X:label [multiple allowed], (must be in 2nd nibble)
4 	Call 2 byte/Channel 	C:label (as above, but checks and replaces default channel)
5 	Unused
6	End, type is iFloat. 	N (must be in 2nd nibble)
7 	End, type is String.	S (must be in 2nd nibble)
8	( next					( 
9	) next 					) 
A	, next					, 
B,C,D Unused
E 	any number value pushed	#
F 	string value pushed 	$

0-3 in the end adds 0-2
